/**
 * AIBackend is the seam between the editor and any AI provider surface.
 *
 * In integrated mode the default implementation talks to the same Go backend
 * that's served everything before this abstraction existed; in OSS mode it
 * talks to the local ai-server. The interface is intentionally narrow — it
 * exposes:
 *
 *   - `capabilities()` so the editor can learn which providers have keys
 *     configured and decide which UI to gate behind a BYOK prompt.
 *   - `request<T>()` as a thin escape hatch so existing call sites can be
 *     migrated incrementally onto the abstraction without forcing a complete
 *     surface freeze. Once enough call sites migrate, this method narrows
 *     into typed per-feature methods (`generateText`, `generateImage`, etc.).
 *
 * Key handling rule (BYOK):
 *
 *   When a user has supplied a BYOK key for some provider, the backend
 *   implementation forwards it as the `X-BYOK-Key` header on requests that
 *   target that provider. Env-supplied keys on the server always take
 *   precedence over BYOK keys — the server decides. The editor never makes
 *   provider-selection decisions on the client.
