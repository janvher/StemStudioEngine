/**
 * Author-facing spatial-query API. Today exposes Three.js's bundled `Octree`
 * for collision detection against scene geometry — the most common need in
 * a 3D engine. The façade is namespaced so additional spatial structures
 * (kd-tree, BVH, generic AABB index) can land alongside it without
 * disturbing the existing surface.
 *
 * Octree builds itself from a Three.js Group / scene; it doesn't take
 * arbitrary insert/remove. Use it when you have static (or rebuilt-each-
 * frame) world geometry and need fast capsule/sphere/ray queries against
 * it. For dynamic per-entity AABB queries, roll a small lookup or wait for
 * a future `erth.spatial.aabb` add-on.
