# Stem Script

Stem Script is the editor DSL for describing scene changes in StemStudio. It is
not a general-purpose scripting language. Each line resolves to an immutable
command intent: a command name plus normalized parameters. That intent crosses
the editor/engine boundary through `CommandsRegistry` and then executes in the
engine through a registered handler.

That command boundary is the important part. Copilot, the Script Tool terminal,
scene export, scene import, and validation all speak the same command contract.
The handler may mutate the scene, import an asset, or configure runtime state,
but the Stem Script line itself is a stable request that can be inspected,
validated, replayed, saved, reviewed, and diffed.

A `.stemscript` file is a plain-text sequence of those editor commands. It can
build or modify a scene: create primitives, import assets, attach behaviors,
configure cameras and lighting, set physics, and export a replayable bundle.

Existing example games in this format live in
[Stem-Studio/Games-StemScript](https://github.com/Stem-Studio/Games-StemScript).
Use that repository when you want complete game folders with a root
`.stemscript` file and companion assets.

## Put StemStudio in Stem Script mode

The public playground opens the editor at `/dashboard?mode=playground`. From
there:

1. Open **Playground** from the public site, or open the editor route with
   `?mode=playground`.
2. Open **AI Copilot**.
3. Enter Script Tool mode:
   - Type `/script` in Copilot chat, or
   - Hold the **AI Copilot** button and choose **Script Tool** from the menu.
4. Run commands directly, or run `exec` to pick a `.stemscript` file or a folder
   containing one.
5. Use `exit` to leave Script Tool mode and return to Copilot chat.

The Script Tool is available to project owners/admin users. In playground
copilot chat, the AI can also return Stem Script directly; the editor validates
and applies those commands through the same command registry.

On the dashboard, the **Import stemscript folder** banner is the fastest path
for complete games. Pick a folder that contains a `.stemscript` file plus its
referenced models, textures, audio, videos, behavior YAMLs, lambda YAMLs, and
imports. StemStudio stages the folder, executes the script in a fresh project,
imports the companion files, and saves the result into the active local project
store.

## File shape and syntax

Stem Script is line-oriented. Each non-comment line becomes one command intent:

```stemscript
# Comments start with #
project title "Tiny Obby"
add group name=Level
add box name=Ground size=12,0.1,12 position=0,-0.05,0 color=#2d3748 parent=Level
add capsule name=Player size=0.5,1.8,0.5 position=0,0.9,0 color=#3b82f6
update Player tag=Player
physics engine rapier gravity=-9.81
physics set Ground config={shape:"box",mass:0,ctype:"Static"}
behavior attach Player behaviorId=character config={isDefault:true,walkSpeed:3,runSpeed:6,jumpHeight:1.2}
camera "DefaultCamera" cameraType=THIRD_PERSON defaultDistance=6
game settings isGame=true showHUD=true
```

Rules to remember:

| Syntax | Notes |
|---|---|
| One command per line | Empty lines and `#` comments are ignored. |
| `key=value` parameters | Most commands accept named parameters. Bare first arguments are used for targets, such as `update Player color=#ff0000`. |
| Quote spaces | Use `"Default Camera"` or `"Racing Kart"` when a value contains spaces. |
| Vectors | Positions, rotations, sizes, and scales usually use `x,y,z`, for example `position=0,1,0`. |
| Objects and arrays | Config blocks use JSON-like values, for example `config={shape:"box",mass:0}` or `phrases=["tree","forest"]`. |
| Shorthand and raw commands | Shorthand such as `add box` maps to registry commands such as `create_primitive`. Advanced scripts can call supported raw registry names directly. |

The parser does not run arbitrary JavaScript. It tokenizes the line, resolves
aliases such as `add box` or `physics set`, normalizes parameters, and sends the
resulting command object to the editor command registry. This keeps AI output,
manual terminal input, imports, and exported bundles on the same engine-facing
API.

Run `help` inside the Script Tool for the live command list. Run
`help <command>` or `help <category>` for parameter details, for example
`help add`, `help behavior`, `help scene`, or `help import`.

## Command boundary model

Stem Script has four layers:

| Layer | Role |
|---|---|
| DSL text | The user-facing language: `add box name=Crate position=0,1,0`. |
| Parsed command intent | An immutable command name and parameter payload, such as `create_primitive` with `{type:"box", name:"Crate", position:{x:0,y:1,z:0}}`. |
| Command registry | The engine-facing contract that declares supported commands, parameter definitions, and handlers. |
| Engine handler | The implementation that performs the mutation: add an object, update material state, import an asset, attach a behavior, or read scene state. |

This gives Stem Script two useful properties:

| Property | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Replayability | The same command file can be executed by the terminal, import flow, export replay, or browser-direct copilot. |
| Reviewability | A command intent is narrower than arbitrary code, so generated changes can be inspected before or after they cross into the engine. |
| Compatibility | Shorthand syntax can evolve while raw registry command names preserve a stable engine boundary. |
| Validation | Read-only getters and admin check/test commands can derive probes from mutation commands and compare the scene after execution. |

Think of Stem Script as the authoring protocol for the editor. Behavior code and
lambda code still use JavaScript for runtime logic, but Stem Script is the DSL
for declaring editor operations and asset/project reconstruction steps.

## Commands available to users

The Script Tool groups commands by what they edit:

| Area | Commands |
|---|---|
| Objects | `add <type>`, `add group`, `add model`, `add prefab`, `update`, `delete`, `clone`, `move`, `list objects`, `list lights`, `get`, typed getters such as `get box`, `select`, `player`. |
| Materials and textures | `material`, `texture`, `texture external`, `get material`, `get texture`. |
| Physics | `physics engine`, `physics enable`, `physics disable`, `physics set`, `get physics engine`, `get physics`, `scene compartments`, `get compartments`. |

## Import and export workflows

Use `exec` when you already have a `.stemscript` file:

```stemscript
exec
```

With no path, the browser opens a picker. You can select a single
`.stemscript` file, or a folder containing one `.stemscript` plus companion
assets. Folder execution uses relative paths from the picked folder, so script
lines such as these can resolve local files:

```stemscript
import model Kart models/kart.glb
import behavior KartController behaviors/kart-controller.yaml
import lambda TrackGravity lambdas/track-gravity.yaml
import script name="math-helpers" filepath="imports/math-helpers.js"
import image ProjectCover cover.png
```

Use `dump scene` when you want an offline-replayable zip with binary assets
included. Use `export scene` when asset URLs are acceptable and you want a
lighter bundle. Both produce a main `.stemscript` entrypoint plus behavior,
lambda, import, and asset metadata needed to recreate the scene.

The OSS playground keeps local script assets latest-only. Server-backed
installations can preserve full asset revision history and pin selected
revisions in the scene's asset resolution context.

## Playground copilot restrictions

Manual Script Tool commands can import, export, dump, save, and execute picked
files. The browser-direct playground copilot is intentionally narrower. It can
inspect the scene with read-only commands and apply live scene edits, but it
rejects generated commands that need filesystem prompts, project-task storage,
external library search, or bundle export.

For AI-generated playground edits, expect the copilot to use commands such as:

```stemscript
list objects
get camera "DefaultCamera"
add box name=Platform size=4,0.25,4 position=0,1,0 color=#475569
behavior attach Player behaviorId=character config={isDefault:true}
```

If a request requires local files, the copilot should explain the exact
`import` or `exec` lines for you to run manually in Script Tool mode instead of
emitting those commands for automatic execution.

## Practical patterns

Use Stem Script for repeatable scene construction:

| Goal | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Build a quick game sketch | Start with `project title`, `game settings`, primitives, player tag, camera, lights, physics, then attach behaviors. |
| Reuse existing assets | Inspect with `list assets`, `list models`, `list behavior packs`, `list lambda packs`, then reference exact names/IDs. |
| Add gameplay logic | Prefer built-in behaviors first. Use `behavior add` or imported behavior YAML when custom behavior code is needed. |
| Move many objects into a group | Create the group once with `add group`, then use `parent=<group>` on creation or `move <target> parent=<group>`. |
| Debug a script | Run a small script first, use `history`, `get <target>`, `scene settings`, and admin `check`/`test` where available. |

For complete examples, start with
[Stem-Studio/Games-StemScript](https://github.com/Stem-Studio/Games-StemScript),
import a game folder through the dashboard or `exec`, then inspect the command
history and generated project state in the editor.
